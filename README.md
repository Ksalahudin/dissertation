Hybrid Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to develop a robust credit card fraud detection system using a hybrid approach, 
combining various machine learning algorithms for enhanced accuracy and efficiency. 
The implementation involves two stages: in the first stage, several classifiers, 
including XGBoost, LGBM, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Random Forests, SVM, and AdaBoost, 
were individually trained and evaluated. The second stage involves the development of hybrid models 
by combining the top-performing classifiers to leverage their strengths and compensate for weaknesses.
